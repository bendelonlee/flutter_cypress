Is it possible to simulate a drag and drop in flutter from Cypress?

In chrome devtools, able to trigger a pointerdown event that seems to 'start dragging' a list item. However, I've tried to move it with a pointermove event, no dice. Not sure if this is possible. 

Even if it were possible, there are more barriers when dispatching the event to Flutter in Cypress. See: https://github.com/bendelonlee/flutter_cypress/blob/master/scroll.md
